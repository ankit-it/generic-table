# generic-table

The intent of this project is to create a way to implement a reuasble table/list view. i.e the table view implementation should not have any impact on adding a new kind of cell/view.

In the current implementation only the viewable data can be used. Means there is no way implemented to get the interaction back to the view.(WIP)
